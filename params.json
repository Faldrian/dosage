Please be aware that by making downloaded\r\nstrips publically available (without the explicit permission of the author)\r\nyou may be infringing upon various copyrights.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, dosage respects the robots.txt exclusion protocol. This\r\nmakes sure no content is accessed in an automatic way without consent\r\nby the publishers.\r\n\r\nIf you are a publisher of comics and want dosage to access your files,\r\nadd the following entry to your robotst.txt file:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUser-agent: dosage\r\nAllow: *\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdult content\r\n--------------\r\nSome comics contain adult content and require age confirmation.\r\nThese comics can only be downloaded by using the --adult option,\r\nwhich confirms that you are old enough to view them.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n------\r\nList available comics (ca. 3000 at the moment):\r\n\r\n`$ dosage -l`\r\n\r\nGet the latest comic of for example CalvinAndHobbes and save it in the \"Comics\"\r\ndirectory:\r\n\r\n`$ dosage CalvinAndHobbes`\r\n\r\nIf you already have downloaded several comics and want to get the latest\r\nstrip of all of them:\r\n\r\n`$ dosage @`\r\n\r\nFor advanced options and features execute `dosage -h` or look at the dosage\r\nmanual page.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n-------------\r\nPython version 2.7 or higher, which can be downloaded\r\nfrom http://www.python.org/\r\n\r\nAlso the python-requests module must be installed, which can be downloaded\r\nfrom http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n-------------\r\nYou can invoke Dosage directly from the source code as \"./dosage\". Alternatively,\r\nyou can install Dosage using python distutils by invoking setup.py in\r\nthe root of the distribution. For example:\r\n\r\n`python setup.py install`\r\n\r\nor if you do not have root permissions:\r\n\r\n`python setup.py install --home=$HOME`\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use pip:\r\n\r\n`pip install dosage`\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n----------------------\r\nDosage is written in Python and relies on regular expressions to\r\ndo most of the grunt work.\r\n\r\nFor each webcomic Dosage has a plugin module, found in the \"plugins\"\r\nsubdirectory of the dosagelib directory. Each module is a subclass of\r\nthe _BasicComic class and specifies where to download its comic images.\r\nSome comic syndicates (ucomics for example) have a standard layout for all\r\ncomics. For such cases there are general base classes derived from _BasicComic\r\nwhich help define the plugins for all comics of this syndicate.\r\n\r\nExtending Dosage\r\n-----------------\r\nIn order to add a new webcomic, a new module class has to be created in\r\none of the *.py files in the dosagelib/plugins subdirectory.\r\nLook at the existing module classes for examples.\r\n\r\nReporting Bugs\r\n---------------\r\nYou can report bugs, patches or requests at the Github issue tracker at\r\nhttps://github.com/wummel/dosage/issues\r\n\r\nDosage currently supports a large number of comics and that number grows on\r\na regular basis. If you feel that there are comics that Dosage does not\r\ncurrently support but should support, please feel free to request them.\r\n"}
