\fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-all\fP
Traverses all available strips backwards from the current one.

or update an existing one where files are missing.

Catchups can start at a specific strip by using the index syntax, see
the
.B INDEX SYNTAX
and

at a certain strip. The index can be specified by appending a colon \fB:\fP
and the index name after the module. Multiple comma-spearated indices can
