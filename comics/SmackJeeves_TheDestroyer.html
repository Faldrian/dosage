<h2>Dosage comic SmackJeeves/TheDestroyer</h2>
<table class="comicinfo">
<tr>
<th>Description</th><td>A Shadow-cat demon named Kairo Ventaiga finds his solitude interrupted when he finds out his family isn't dead. However, he's gotten used to his deadly lifestyle and doesn't want to change... In a neighboring kingdom, Princess Nicole, a daughter of Light, doesn't want her father's crown. She is strangely sympathetic toward Shadow demons, her kind's mortal enemy. She's determined to befriend the Destroyer; perhaps she knows something Kairo doesn't... Reilyn Ventaiga only wants to find out what happened to his parents the night Kairo disappeared, but getting any answers out of his brother is looking more and more impossible... TakJak, a former thief, starts to notice that the Heartless Destroyer isn't as heartless as he seems... Updates: every Saturday with one or two pages Warning for minors: contains prevalent cursing, blood and gore, violence, and maaaybe farther down the line, partial nudity or hints at it. Also gay people. If you don't like any of the above, I'd advise against reading my comic.</td>
