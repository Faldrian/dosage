<th>Description</th><td>Rei, a 15 year old student, has to switch to a new school because of an accident that killed another student at his old school. Rei knows there is something wrong with him because everytime he's angry, any living thing he touches dies within a week. On Rei's first day at his new school, his bad luck lands him a detention and he ends up injuring himself on some equipment not put away properly. Harumi, a girl in Rei's class attempts to help him but immediately backs off after seeing his wound completely heal itself before her eyes. Rei, not wanting to have this shocking discovery spread, and not wanting to move schools again decides that his only option is to make a deal and keep a sharp eye on Harumi, even if stalking is necessary. But, even with Rei's efforts to keep his ability secret, somehow people find out about it... These people call themselves &quot;viruses&quot; that have the intention to kill Rei for being the &quot;one of immortal blood&quot;. Due to the constant attacks, Rei and Harumi search to find answers about Reiâ€™s past and why these &quot;viruses&quot; are after him. *** READ FROM RIGHT TO LEFT &gt;Shounen &gt;UPDATED WHENEVER POSSIBLE, SO PLEASE BEAR WITH ME!&lt; OTL</td>
