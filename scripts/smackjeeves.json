He is then saved by a person by the name of Sasha(Alexander). Alexander Domini is a noble demon who is also half incubus(due to his mother's side of the family). He is from the demon world of Haos, or what humans call Hell. Haos is divided by where all the demons and other creatures live and where damned souls go by certain Islands and continents.
