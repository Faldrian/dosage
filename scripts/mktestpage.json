Silver August of Harvestone Town is a teen that never really knew life outside his hometown; however after rescuing his Sister from the hands of Team Reaction, Silver becomes motivated to explore the world as a Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Trainer! However on his journey, Silver discovers that behind the battles he'd watch on TV lies corruption because of devices known as \"Modifiers\" that allow a Trainer to alter a Pokemon's stats by force without having to earn them through training. This leads Silver and the friends he makes along the way to form \"The Silver League Movement\" which vows to travel the region, collecting badges but also recruiting Gym Leaders and convincing them to join their cause so that they can form a league of their own, take down the Team Reaction organization and bring honour, fun and hard work back to Pokemon Battles! http://www.thesilverleague.com/", "error": null, "genre": "Other", "name": "SmackJeeves/TheSilverLeague", "status": "ok", "url": "http://thesilverleague.smackjeeves.com/comics/"}, "SmackJeeves_TheSixthBar": {"adult": false, "description": "The war between Del-Naaj and Saam-Sara has ended, but Nero knows otherwise.
